Change Podfile like below:

  post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)
    __apply_Xcode_12_5_M1_post_install_workaround(installer)
    `sed -i -e  $'s/__IPHONE_10_0/__IPHONE_12_0/' Pods/RCT-Folly/folly/portability/Time.h`
  end

//////

(2) On Android device: "Unable to load script. Make sure you're either running Metro (run 'react-native start') or that your bundle 'index.android.bundle' is packaged correctly for release."
`adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`
